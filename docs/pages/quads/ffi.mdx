`r` is a wrap containing the function described by `y` in the dynamic library at path `x`, which defaults to the C standard library if not provided. `y` is a vector of at least two strings. The first element of `y` is the return type of the function; the second element is the name of the symbol; the elements after the second are the arguments of the function. The resulting wrapped function must be called monadically with a vector of arguments.
