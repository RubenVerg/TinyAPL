`r` contains the following entries:

## `null`: Null Pointer

A null pointer of type `u8`.

## `New`: New Object

Left argument is a type (as per [`⎕FFI`](/docs/quads/ffi)), right argument is a value compatible with that type. Allocates memory and stores that value. Returns the pointer as a pointer object.

## `NewA`: New Array of Objects

Left argument is a type, right argument is a vector of values compatible with that type. Allocates memory and stores those values contiguously. Returns a pointer to the beginning of the values as a pointer object.

## `NewZ`: New Zero-terminated Array of Objects

Left argument is a type, right argument is a vector of values compatible with that type. Allocates memory and stores those values contiguously, followed by a zero. Returns a pointer ot the beginning of the values as a pointer object.

## `Alloc`: Allocate

Left argument is a natural, which defaults to `1`. Right argument is a type. Allocates memory enough to fit left argument values of right argument type, and fills the memory with zeros. Returns a pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory.

## `Free`: Free

Argument is a pointer returned by any pointer-creating function both from here and from `⎕FFI`. Frees the pointer.

## `SizeOf`: Size Of

Argument is an array of strings. Each string is replaced with the size of the type it describes, in bytes.
