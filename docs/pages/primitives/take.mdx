`x` must be a scalar or vector of integers. `r` is the result of taking from each axis of `y` as many elements as specified by the corresponding element of `x`. If `x` is positive, the first `x` elements are taken; if `x` is negative, the last `x` elements are taken; if `x` is zero, no element is taken. Supports tbe `backward` extra argument, which negates `x`.

## Overtake

If the `fill` extra argument is provided, axes where the corresponding element of `x` is (in absolute value) larger than the axis length are filled with the fill provided.

## Outfix

<planned />

If (an element of) `x` is nested, it must be a two-element vector, with the first item a nonnegative integer and the second item a nonpositive integer. In that case, the items taken on the corresponding axis are the first `⊃x` and the last `-⊇x`, except that if they overlap they're taken only once.
