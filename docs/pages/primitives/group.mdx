`x` is a vector of integers, with length equal to the tally of `y`. `r` is a nested vector containing major cells of `y`, in the positions marked by corresponding entries in `x`. Cells that correspond to a negative number are dropped from `r`. Supports the `origin` extra argument, which offsets `x` by the origin.
