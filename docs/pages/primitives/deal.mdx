`x` must be a natural vector and `y` must be a natural scalar and `×/x` must be less than or equal to `y`. `r` is the result of selecting `×/x` elements from the numbers `0` to `y-1`, without repetitions, reshaped to be of shape `x`. Supports the `origin` extra argument, which offsets the result by the origin.
