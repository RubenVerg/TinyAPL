If `x` and `y` are arrays:

`x` and `y`, after extension, must have the same trailing axes (that is, the only difference in shape is the first element). Extension is as follows:

* if `x` and `y` have the same rank, no operation is performed
* if one of the arguments has rank one less than the other, the argument with lesser rank is promoted to have a 1-length leading axis
* if one of the arguments is scalar, it is reshaped to an array with leading axis of length 1 and trailing axes of the other argument
* if both arguments are scalar, they are reshaped to 1-element vectors.

After extension, `r` is the major cells of `x` followed by the major cells of `y`. Supports the `fill` extra argument, which is used to pad the two arrays to have matching shape.

If `x` and `y` are dictionaries, `r` is the dictionary containing all entries from `x` and `y`, right-biased. Supports the `tolerance` extra argument for the comparison of the keys.
