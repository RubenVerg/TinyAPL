`r` is the result of the scalar application of the roll function on `y`, which must be a natural array:

* if `y` is `0`, `r` is a random float between `0` and `1`, exclusive
* otherwise, `r` is a random integer from `0` to `y-1`.

Supports the `origin` extra argument, which offsets the result by the origin (when it's not a float).
