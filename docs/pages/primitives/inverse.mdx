`r` is the result of calling the inverse of `F` on \[`x` and\] `y`. Each function can have up to four inverses:

* an *un*-inverse, which is the monadic inverse, accessed by `F˝ y`; usually at least one of&nbsp;<hl code='y ≡ F F˝ y' />&nbsp;or&nbsp;<hl code='y ≡ F˝ F y' />&nbsp;holds;
* an *anti*-inverse, which is the inverse formed after binding the left argument, accessed by `x F˝ y`; usually at least one of&nbsp;<hl code='y ≡ x F x F˝ y' />&nbsp;or&nbsp;<hl code='y ≡ x F˝ x F y' />&nbsp;holds;
* a *contra*-inverse, which is the inverse formed after binding the right argument, accessed by `x F⍨˝⍨ y`; usually at least one of&nbsp;<hl code='x ≡ (x F y) F˝ y' />&nbsp;or&nbsp;<hl code='x ≡ (x F˝ y) F y' />&nbsp;holds;
* a *dis*-inverse, which is the full dyadic inverse, accessed by `Fᑒ/˝ y` (or, when the two results are shape-compatible, by `F/˝ y`); usually&nbsp;<hl code='y ≡ Fᑒ/ Fᑒ/˝ y' />&nbsp;holds.
