`r` is a boolean array with the same shape as `y` indicating whether at the corresponding position there is the beginning of a subarray that is equal to `x`. Supports the `tolerance` extra argument for the comparisons; supports the `backward` extra argument, which marks the biggest coordinate instead of the smallest.
