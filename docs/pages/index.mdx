TinyAPL is a tiny[^1] APL dialect and interpreter in Haskell.

It is being implemented in a [series of posts](https://blog.rubenverg.com/?tag=tinyapl) on my blog.

Source code is available [<i class='bi bi-github'></i> on GitHub](https://github.com/RubenVerg/tinyapl).

This documentation is split in three parts: information, which contains useful info; primitives, which describe each primitive (including planned ones); quad names, which describe each quad name and list its category (Core, for quad names that are always available; I/O, for quad names that are only available in contexts where IO can be performed).

[^1]: Well, I say tiny, but there's ~200 primitives...
